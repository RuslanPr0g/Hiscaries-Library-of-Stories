## 🚀 Local Development Setup!

### Prerequisites

You will need

- Docker Engine
- DotNet CLI and SDK

to run the application locally.

### Backend

To set up the backend environment, simply run:

```powershell
SetUp-LocalEnv.ps1
```

or bash if you're on linux

```bash
chmod +x setup-localenv.sh

setup-localenv.sh
```

This will configure the backend using .NET Aspire.

```powershell
Add-Migration.ps1
```

This will add a new migration to the chosen service.

To run the backend application, please set Hiscary.AppHost as your startup project and hit run!

#### Domain-Driven Design (DDD) with StackNucleus

This application leverages **StackNucleus**, a package that helps in modeling Domain-Driven Design (DDD) in .NET. StackNucleus is integrated into the backend to structure the domain logic and ensure clean, maintainable architectures. It simplifies the modeling of aggregates, entities, and value objects in a way that aligns with DDD principles.
